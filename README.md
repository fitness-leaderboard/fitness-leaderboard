## Scope of Work:

Included: Exercise tracking, leaderboard, proof verification, and user profiles.

Not Included: Full-fledged social networking features, and extensive data analytics.

## Implementation Plan:

a. Week 1: Planning, Requirement Gathering, Database (MongoDB) Setup.

b. Week 2-4: Backend Development (Express.js, TypeScript, MongoDB) and API Implementation.
