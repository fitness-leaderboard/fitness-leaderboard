# NEU-Leaderboard
Fitness leaderboard to compete with your classmates

# Project Proposal: [Name TBD]

## Project Title:

TBD

## Project Overview:

[NAME] is a free fitness and health competition platform designed for Northeastern University students, but we hope to expand to all schools. The project aims to encourage a healthy lifestyle by allowing students to compete against each other in various exercises and health activities. The platform prioritizes running, swimming, biking, steps, sleep hours, and weightlifting exercises.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Target Audience:

Northeastern University students seeking a competitive and motivating environment to enhance their fitness and health.

Features and Functionality:

a. Exercise Tracking: Users will have their logged running, swimming, biking, steps, etc sync from other platforms such as Strava. People can also post their 1rm, but must provide a video for proof/validation.

b. Leaderboard: Real-time leaderboard showcasing top performers in each category. 

c. Proof Verification: Users are required to submit proof (photos or videos) for verification (specifically for their lifts, since their isn't 1 app that monopolizes weight training logging).

d. Web and App Versions: Full-featured website and a corresponding app with limited capabilities for exercise logging and leaderboard viewing.

## Technologies Used:

Backend: Express.js in TypeScript, MongoDB for the database.

Frontend: React for the web and React Native for the app.

Database: MongoDB (Community Edition).

Hosting: Deployment provided by Vercel for both frontend and backend.

## Scope of Work:

Included: Exercise tracking, leaderboard, proof verification, and user profiles.

Not Included: Full-fledged social networking features, and extensive data analytics.

## Implementation Plan:

a. Week 1: Planning, Requirement Gathering, Database (MongoDB) Setup.

b. Week 2-4: Backend Development (Express.js, TypeScript, MongoDB) and API Implementation.

c. Week 5-7: Frontend Development (React, React Native) for Web and App.

d. Week 8: Testing, User Feedback, and Iteration.

## Conclusion:

 [NAME] aims to bring the Northeastern University community together through friendly fitness competitions. By leveraging modern technologies, the platform provides an engaging and competitive space for students to prioritize their health and well-being. The project is committed to being free of charge, ensuring accessibility for all students. MongoDB and Vercel have been chosen for their scalability, ease of use, and compatibility with the project's goals.
